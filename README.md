# Priority Todo Manager

Welcome to the Priority Todo Manager, an innovative task management application developed by Team #2 CWUsers from Central Washington University for the MLP Crimson Code Hackathon 2024.

## Getting Started

Clone the repository and navigate to the project directory to begin. Below are the commands to set up and run the application.

### `npm start`

This command runs the app in development mode. Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser. The page will reload with your edits, and lint errors will be shown in the console.

### `npm test`

Execute this command to launch the test runner in interactive watch mode. For more information, see the [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) section of the Create React App documentation.
